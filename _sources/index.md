# Tahoe-100M single cell perturbation atlas data analysis

Tahoe-100M is a giga-scale single cell perturbation dataset contains 100 milion cells. We provides an optimized analysis pipeline for such scale single cell perturbation data, harnessing the power of RAPIDS and Scanpy. 
The repository features GPU/CPU-accelerated PCA computation and UMAP visualization techniques, 
delivering rapid dimensionality reduction and interactive data exploration.
